The jdemetra-app project contains all the graphical part of the JDemetra+ software, including additional peripheral modules 
around time series (structural models, benchmarking, temporal disaggregation...). 
The graphical components are based on the NetBeans platform.

As far as seasonal adjustment is concerned, JDemetra+ is based on the programs TRAMO-SEATS(+) and X12-ARIMA.

The program TRAMO-SEATS+ is developed by Gianluca Caporello and Agustin Maravall -with programming support from Domingo Perez 
and Roberto Lopez- at the Bank of Spain. It is based on the program TRAMO-SEATS, 
previously developed by Victor Gomez and Agustin Maravall.

The program X12-ARIMA was produced by the US-Census Bureau. It can be downloaded from the following address:
